## Data structures

### zip_file_t

![zip_password_t diagram](/diagrams/zip_password_t.svg)

Struct that contains the data related to a zip file:

 1. file_path: [string] the path to the file
 2. pass: [string] the file's password
 3. pass_found: [boolean] indicates whether the password was found
 4. can_access_password_found: [mutex] grants access to pass_found
 5. pass_info: [pointer] points to a password_info_t instance
 6. next_zip: [pointer] points to the next zip to be decrypted

### password_info_t

![password_information_t diagram](/design/diagrams/password_information_t.svg)

Struct that contains the data related to a zip file:

 1. pass_length: [int] the password's length
 2. pass_alphabet: [char*] an array with the characters used in the password
 3. pass_counter: [int] amount of passwords to be generated
 4. alphabet_size: [int] amount of characters in the alphabet
 5. thread_amount: [int] amount of threads to be used

### temp_data_t

 ![temp_data_t diagram](/design/diagrams/temp_data_t.svg)

  Struct that contains the data related to a zip file for a specific thread:

  1. current_size: [int] the current size of the password
  2. temp_file_path: [string] the path to the temporary file
  3. comb_ini: [int] the initial combination to be generated by the thread
  4. comb_end: [int] the final combination to be generated by the thread
  5. zip_password: [pointer] points to a zip_password_t instance
